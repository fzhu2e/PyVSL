    Translated from VSLite_v2_3.m - Simulate tree ring width index given monthly climate inputs.

    Basic Usage:
       trw = VSLite_v2_3(syear,eyear,phi,T1,T2,M1,M2,T,P)
       gives just simulated tree ring as ouput.
    
      [trw,gT,gM,gE,M] = VSLite_v2_3(syear,eyear,phi,T1,T2,M1,M2,T,P))
       also includes growth response to temperature, growth response to soil
       moisture, scaled insolation index, and soil moisture estimate in outputs.
    
    Basic Inputs:
      syear = start year of simulation.
      eyear = end year of simulation.
      phi = latitude of site (in degrees N)
      T1 = scalar temperature threshold below which temp. growth response is zero (in deg. C)
      T2 = scalar temperature threshold above which temp. growth response is one (in deg. C)
      M1 = scalar soil moisture threshold below which moist. growth response is zero (in v/v)
      M2 = scalar soil moisture threshold above which moist. growth response is one (in v/v)
        (Note that optimal growth response parameters T1, T2, M1, M2 may be estimated
         using code estimate_vslite_params_v2_3.m also freely available at
         the NOAA NCDC Paleoclimatology software library.)
      T = (12 x Nyrs) matrix of ordered mean monthly temperatures (in degEes C)
      P = (12 x Nyrs) matrix of ordered accumulated monthly precipitation (in mm)
    
    Advanced Inputs (must be specified as property/value pairs):
        'lbparams':  Parameters of the Leaky Bucket model of soil moisture.
                   These may be specified in an 8 x 1 vector in the following
                   order (otherwise the default values are read in):
                      Mmax: scalar maximum soil moisture content (in v/v),
                        default value is 0.76
                      Mmin: scalar minimum soil moisture (in v/v), default
                        value is 0.01
                      alph: scalar runoff parameter 1 (in inverse months),
                        default value is 0.093
                      m_th: scalar runoff parameter 3 (unitless), default
                        value is 4.886
                      mu_th: scalar runoff parameter 2 (unitless), default
                        value is 5.80
                      rootd: scalar root/"bucket" depth (in mm), default
                        value is 1000
                      M0: initial value for previous month's soil moisture at
                        t = 1 (in v/v), default value is 0.2
                      substep: logical 1 or 0; perform monthly substepping in
                        leaky bucket (1) or not (0)? Default value is 0.
        'intwindow': Integration window. Which months' growth responses should
                     be intregrated to compute the annual ring-width index?
                     Specified as a 2 x 1 vector of integer values. Both
                     elements are given in integer number of months since January
                     (July) 1st of the current year in the Northern (Southern)
                     hemisphere, and specify the beginning and end of the integration
                     window, respectively. Defaults is [1 ; 12] (eg. integrate
                     response to climate over the corresponding calendar year,
                     assuming location is in the northern hemisphere).
        'hydroclim': Value is a single character either taking value ['P'] or ['M'].
                     If ['M'], then 9th input is interpreted as an estimate of
                     soil moisture content (in v/v) rather than as precipitation.
                     Model default is to read in precipitation and use the CPC's
                     Leaky Bucket model of hydrology to estimate soil moisture,
                     however if soil moisture observations or a more sophisticated
                     estimate of moisture accounting for snow-related processes
                     is available, then using these data directly are recommended
                     (and will also speed up code).
